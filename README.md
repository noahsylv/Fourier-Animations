# Fourier-Animations

Implementation in Processing of this animation technique from this video: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r6sGWTCMz2k&t=1170s

How to use:
1. Run FourierAnimations.pde (note you must have processing, download here: https://processing.org/)
2. Press 'd' to enter draw mode
3. Click and move mouse to draw shape (should be continuous and start and end in same stop)
4. Press 'f' to solve
5. You can press 'a' to see the shape and space to see the arrows
6. To increase or decrease the number of vectors, use 'q' and 'w'

Controls:
Space: show/hide arrows
'r' : generate new random set of vectors
'd' : start/stop draw mode
'f' : solve drawn shape/ flip direction
'a' : show drawn shape
'q' : increase number of vectors
'w' : decrease number of vectors
'c' : clear drawing
